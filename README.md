# Prism-ide
What is Prism IDE? â€“ IDE is the front-end bot designer that provides cool drag & drop, point & click capabilities that will feed into the Prism bot library.

Prism IDE is currently used to build chatbots internally with testing still in progress. Unit test suites are still being developed. Please use it as you see fit. We'd love to have you participate in developing unit test cases for Prism!

-	IDE works out of the local file system making version control very easy!
-	Provides a built-in code syntax highlighter and formatter for modifying JavaScript within the IDE
-	Enable your chatbot to talk slow to make it realistic or respond instantly depending on your need
-	Provides ability to manage (Enable/Disable) intents, commands and tasks
